        <h1> COOKING THE PASTA PERECTLY</H1>

    <p>
        
            Let’s start with the pasta. Bring a big pot of salted water to a 
            rolling boil. Remember, you want the water salty like the sea to infuse 
            the pasta with flavor from the inside out. Large elbow macaroni is my 
            go-to for that classic look and bite, but feel free to get creative! 
            Here are a few other pasta shapes that work great:
    
    </p>

    <li>
            <b>Cavatappi</b> (corkscrews): These are perfect for catching all the 
            creamy sauce in their curves.
    </li>
   
    <li>        
            <b>Penne</b> or <b>rigatoni:</b> Their hollow centers are great for 
             holding onto that luscious cheese sauce.
    </li>   
    
    <li>    
            <b>Shells:</b> They create little pockets that soak up all the cheesy 
             goodness.
    </li>

    <p>
       
            Regardless of which shape you choose, cook it at al dente or a minute 
            under since it’ll continue to cook in the oven. This way, it won’t end 
            up overcooked and mushy. Once your pasta is ready, drain it thoroughly 
            but don’t rinse it. The starch left on the pasta will help the sauce 
            cling better!
    </p>
    
    <h1>CREATING A DREAMY CHEESE SAUCE</h1>
    
    <p>
        
            Now, let’s talk about the magic that is the cheese sauce. Start by 
            melting unsalted butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Once 
            melted, whisk in just enough flour to create a roux. This is what will 
            thicken your sauce and give it that luxurious texture. Let it cook for 
            a couple of minutes until it’s golden and smells a little nutty.
        </p>

        width="400" height="500">


    <p>
            Here’s a tip: <b>whisk in minced garlic</b> after your roux has cooked 
            to infuse it with flavor before adding the liquid. You can also saute 
            the garlic in the butter before adding the flour if that’s easier for 
            you. Slowly pour in warm heavy cream while whisking continuously to 
            avoid lumps. <b>TRUST ME,</b> using warm cream instead of cold makes 
            all the difference — it helps the sauce stay smooth and prevents it 
            from breaking.  
    </p>


    <p>
            Once the cream is incorporated, mix in softened cream cheese for 
            that extra creamy texture. Then, season it up with a mix of dry 
            mustard powder, smoked paprika, a hint of nutmeg, and a dash of 
            cayenne for a subtle kick. These spices elevate the flavor profile 
            without overpowering it. Season with salt and pepper to taste. 
            <b>DON’T</b> go too crazy with the salt though because keep in 
            mind, the cheese will melt in and naturally salt the sauce. You 
            can always add more salt later at the end after tasting.

    <h1>Cheese Selection & Grating Tips</h1>  

    <p>
            Here’s the fun part: cheese! I love using a blend of sharp cheddar, 
            Colby jack, and smoked gouda, but there are so many delicious options 
            out there:
    </p>
   
    <li>    
    
            <b>Creamy, Melty Cheeses:</b> These cheeses melt beautifully and 
            give your sauce a smooth, velvety texture:
    </li>        
   
      <p>
    
    <li> 
            <b>Fontina:</b> Buttery and rich with a slightly nutty flavor.</li>
    
    <li>
            <b>Gruyère:</b> Adds a nutty, slightly salty taste, perfect for a 
            more sophisticated flavor profile.</li>
    <li>
            <b>Mozzarella:</b> Super gooey with a mild 
            flavor — great for that stretchy, melty goodness.</li>
    <li>
            <b>Monterey Jack:</b> 
            Mild with a creamy texture, great for adding extra meltiness.
    </li>
    <li>
            <b>Havarti:</b> Buttery and soft, with a delicate flavor that pairs 
            well with other cheeses.</li>
    </p>        
    
    
    <p>        
            <b>Bold, Flavorful Cheeses:</b> These cheeses pack more of a punch 
            and add depth to your mac and cheese:
    <li>
            <b>Pecorino Romano:</b> Sharp and salty, a little goes a long way! 
            It adds a nice tang.</li>
    <li>
            <b>Parmesan:</b> Nutty and salty, perfect for adding an umami boost. Best 
            sprinkled on top.</li>
    <li>
            <b>Asiago:</b> Sharp with a nutty, buttery flavor, perfect if you want a 
            bolder taste.</li>
    <li>
            White Cheddar: Stronger and tangier than regular cheddar, adds a rich 
            depth.</li>
    </p>        
    
    <p>
            Tip: Always grate your own cheese instead of using pre-shredded. 
            Pre-shredded cheese is coated with anti-caking agents that prevent 
            it from melting smoothly. Grating your own cheese not only melts 
            better but also has a fresher taste. It might take a few extra 
            minutes, but it’s totally worth it for that silky, smooth sauce.
    </p>

    <p>
            To finish the sauce, reduce the heat to low and gradually stir in 
            the shredded cheeses. Keep stirring until everything is completely 
            melted and velvety smooth. At this point, taste and adjust any 
            seasonings to your liking.
